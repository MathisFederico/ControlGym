""" Module for unit tests.

Unit tests are meant to test ONE aspect of the behavior of one UNIQUE function.
Is it expected to have mutliple tests for every function, as it allows to cover
the multiple behavior that we expect this function to have.

A good practice is to write the (first) test before we even write the function,
it allows to focus on what is it that we are trying to achieve now and how can we evaluate
that our function performed successfully.
